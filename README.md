# Project Euler

This repo contains my solutions (written in Rust) to the problems of Project Euler.

I'm learning Rust trying to solve as many problems as possible.

If you want feel free to contribute, but remember that:

1. I'm not a Rust expert so advices to write better Rust programs are welcome;

2. I won't consider any solution to the problems that I've never seen and worked on.
